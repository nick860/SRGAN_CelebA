# SRGAN on CelebA Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of the Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) trained on the CelebA dataset. The SRGAN model is designed to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs, enhancing the detail and quality of facial images.

## Project Overview

The SRGAN model is a type of GAN that focuses on generating realistic, high-resolution images. This implementation uses the CelebA dataset, which is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations.
